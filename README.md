Project: Reliability Enhancement at Continuous Galvanized Line 2 (CGL2) Skin Pass Mill (SPM)
Introduction:
Greetings! I am Dhara Sharma, a final-year undergraduate student from the Mechanical Engineering Department at IIT Kanpur. I had the privilege to participate in the esteemed Women of Mettle Season 6 competition organized by Tata Steel. In this competition, I delved into a project that aimed to enhance the reliability and operational efficiency of the Continuous Galvanized Line 2 (CGL2) Skin Pass Mill (SPM).

Project Overview:
My project revolved around the challenges posed by stability and shape defects that arise at the end of the production process. I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of various facets related to the continuous galvanized line, SPM layout, SPM functions, and operational intricacies. I also conducted a detailed analysis of cold rolling, strip defects, and associated issues.

Key Observations:
One significant challenge was the frequent replacement of backup rolls, necessitating three shutdowns per month, each consuming six hours. This elaborate process involved strip cutting, roll change, gap zeroing, brazing, and strip rethreading, leading to considerable downtime and operational complexities.
A noteworthy insight was the inability to perform gap zeroing after work roll changes, which was recommended by the SPM OEM.

Strategic Recommendations:
I proposed exploring the viability of gap zeroing with a spacer, a move that could potentially slash shutdown time by three hours. While this approach was mentioned in the OEM manual, its practical application was yet to be established.
Another recommendation was the implementation of gap zeroing after every backup roll change, a step that could further optimize downtime.
I emphasized the importance of routine maintenance and inspection activities, including mill calibration, temper fluid nozzle cleaning, and SAP-PM-based preventive measures.
A comprehensive checklist for mill hydraulics maintenance was provided, covering oil reservoir checks, hydraulic pump inspections, accumulator pressure monitoring, and valve thermography analysis.
I stressed the necessity of accurate pass line alignment to achieve precise gap zeroing.
Lastly, I suggested the calibration of critical sensors such as pressure transmitters and position sensors for enhanced measurement accuracy.

Innovative Approaches:
I introduced the idea of applying camber to rolls in the opposite direction to achieve flatness post-deflection, presenting a novel solution.
I recommended the use of hydraulic jacks to control roll elastic deformation, particularly when addressing issues related to wavy edges.
I addressed edge effects through strategies like trimming operations, stretch and roller leveling under tension, and the integration of edge rolls.

Impact and Conclusion:
My project aimed to significantly enhance the operational efficiency of the Continuous Galvanized Line 2 Skin Pass Mill by reducing downtime, improving reliability, and optimizing maintenance practices. The recommendations were rooted in OEM guidelines and industry best practices. This endeavor not only secured a spot in the top 10 of the Women of Mettle Season 6 competition but also contributed valuable insights to the realm of mechanical engineering and industrial processes.
